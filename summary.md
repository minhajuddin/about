## Professional Summary

## Experience

### Sr Software Consultant | Azri Solutions | Hyderabad, India Oct 2016 - Jan 2018

Azri Solutions executes critical projects for their customers. We built out a complete solution for a hotel booking provider which integrated with 50 external inventory suppliers like Expedia, Booking, GTA etc. I was responsible for increasing throughput of our service as the volume of our requests grew and also productionalize the data ingestion from all the external providers.

  - Successfully productionalized the data ingestion pipeline for all the 50 suppliers using Airflow.
  - Redesign the API server to allow scaling out and increased the throughput of the whole service. This allowed adding of servers to increase throughput in a mostly linear fashion.
  - Designed and implemented a complex user accounts system using Phoenix on a Postgresql database.
